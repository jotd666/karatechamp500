This is a 1:1 attempt of a remake of Karate Champ VS on the Amiga 500

try to add more colors (stage 1 gray)

address error on 68000
crouch special case to perform foot sweeps (connect from crouch)
jump special case just for jumping side kick (connect from jump)

jumps are bogus (wrong y on land)
jumping back: turn after complete move (hardcode it)
center display / mask borders
debug mode: if forward pressed, perform high block move
debug mode: if reverse pressed, perform medium block move
debug mode: if reverse+forward pressed, perform low block move

move left: left justify maybe bogus
